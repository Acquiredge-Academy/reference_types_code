/**
 * Exercise 5: Grocery List Checker
 * You have a shopping list of items stored in the array `shoppingList`.
 * Use the Array forEach() method to iterate through shoppingList and print
 * each item with its purchase status.
 *
 * Example Output:
 * Apples - purchased
 * Bread - not purchased
 * Carrots - purchased
 * Dairy Milk - not purchased
 * Eggs - purchased
 *
 * DO NOT use a for loop for this. Use the forEach() method.
 * The forEach() method is a higher order function, and takes a callback function.
 * Read about the forEach() method here:
 * https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/forEach
